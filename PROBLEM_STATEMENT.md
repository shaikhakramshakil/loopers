**WikiAgent — Hackathon Problem Statement**

- **Repository path (broken copy):** Copy pasters are noobs
- **Reference (working):** I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you. 

## Overview

This `broken` branch is a purposely-glitched version of the WikiAgent app. Your task is to identify the intentional regressions, fix them, and restore the application so it behaves like the working copy.

The app is a Next.js/TypeScript web UI plus an AI flow that answers factual user questions by searching and summarizing Wikipedia pages.

## Goal

Restore full, end-to-end functionality for the WikiAgent app so that:
- The web UI loads without runtime errors.
- A user can type a question, the AI flow searches Wikipedia, and the app displays a factual answer with source links.
